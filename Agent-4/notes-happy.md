# Happy - Terminal Escape Sequence Handling

## Overview

Happy does not appear to have specific terminal escape sequence handling. Based on the search results, matches were for unrelated uses of terms like "escape" in JavaScript context (keyboard escape, etc.).

## Key Files

No specific files found related to terminal escape sequence handling.

## Analysis

Happy appears to be a React Native / Expo application (based on file structure with `.tsx` files and app config). The grep matches were for:
- JavaScript/TypeScript escape patterns (not terminal escapes)
- CSS/UI related content
- Translation strings

## OSC Handling Strategy

**Not applicable** - Happy is a mobile/web application that likely does not interface directly with terminal emulators or PTY sessions.

## Notes

- Mobile/Web application architecture
- React Native / Expo based
- No terminal integration
- Would not need escape sequence filtering
